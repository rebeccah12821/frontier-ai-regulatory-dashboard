# Frontier AI Models Regulatory Dashboard

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

An interactive visualization tool comparing global regulations for frontier AI models across major jurisdictions.

## Overview

This dashboard enables legal, policy, and AI professionals to analyze how different governments regulate advanced AI systems. It compares regulatory frameworks from the U.S., EU, China, Singapore, UK, and Japan, focusing on technical thresholds, risk philosophies, and enforcement mechanisms.

## Key Features

### 🌍 Comparative Regulatory Analysis
- **Jurisdiction Comparison Table**  
  Side-by-side view of:
  - Key legislation (EU AI Act, US Executive Order 14110, etc.)
  - Technical thresholds (compute FLOPs, model parameters, training data)
  - Regulatory bodies and enforcement mechanisms
  - Policy status (proposed/enacted)

### 🔍 Interactive Tools
- **Dynamic Filtering**  
  Filter jurisdictions by:
  - Compute power thresholds (e.g., >10^26 FLOPs)
  - Risk focus areas (unpredictability, autonomy, generalization)
  - Regulatory maturity (proposed vs. enacted laws)

- **Risk Philosophy Matrix**  
  Visual comparison of:
  - Regulatory strictness vs. technical complexity
  - Policy approaches (pre-market vs. post-market oversight)

- **Evolution Timeline**  
  Interactive visualization of major AI regulatory milestones (2018-2025)

### 🛠 Technical Implementation
- **Modern Web Stack**
  - Core: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
  - Visualization: D3.js for dynamic charts
  - UI: Responsive HTML5/CSS3 grid layout
  - Data: JSON-structured regulatory metadata
